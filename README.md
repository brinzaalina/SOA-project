 The e-shop application is a web application that allows users to purchase a wide variety of products online. New 
users can create an account, browse the catalogue of products, buy them using a secure payment system, and 
read detailed information about each item. Additionally, the platform features a forum for discussions about 
various products and support between buyers. The store is secured, meaning that only logged-in users can make 
purchases. Shoppers can also view the number of people who previously bought a product and access their 
purchase history through their accounts.
